# clean-paste - text ready to paste, formatting included

ES Tools Clean Paste turns Markdown or rich text into clean formatted text: bold, italic, links, lists and line breaks stay; backgrounds, colors and fonts go; em and en dashes become "-" and typographic quotes become " and '. Pasted into Mail, Gmail or Slack it looks as if it was typed there.

## 1. Is the tool here?

```bash
command -v cleanpaste || ls "/Applications/Clean Paste.app/Contents/Helpers/cleanpaste"
```

- Found: use it (full path if it is not on the PATH).
- Not found, but on a Mac with a shell: say once that ES Tools Clean Paste is missing (install: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/iameryksadowski/estools-app-clean-paste/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh`) and deliver the text in the chat.
- No shell (claude.ai chat, phone): write the text normally; the user copies it and pastes with the Clean Paste shortcut (Control+Option+Command+V).

## 2. A draft to paste

1. Write the text in Markdown: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `- lists`, `1. lists`, `[link](https://...)`, blank lines between paragraphs. Headings become bold lines, so prefer `**1. Topic**` in emails.
2. Save it to a temporary file (body only; the subject goes in the chat, not in the file).
3. Put it on the clipboard:

   ```bash
   cleanpaste /tmp/draft.md --markdown --copy
   ```

4. Tell the user: "In your clipboard - paste with Cmd+V". Show the text in the chat as well, so they can read it before pasting.

A draft file with YAML front matter or notes after a `---` line: add `--body` to paste only the message.

## 3. Other jobs

| Job | Command |
|---|---|
| Fix what is on the clipboard (copied from a web page, a chat, a dark-mode app) | `cleanpaste --repair` |
| Paste straight into the frontmost app (needs Accessibility for the terminal) | `cleanpaste FILE --markdown --paste` |
| See the plain text or the HTML | `--print text`, `--print html`, `--print json` |
| Keep dashes or quotes as they are | `--keep-dashes`, `--keep-quotes` |
| Font size (default: the app setting, 12 px like Apple Mail; 0 = the target app decides) | `--font-size 0` |

Exit codes: 0 done, 1 usage error, 2 nothing to clean, 3 copied but no Accessibility for `--paste` (then say: press Cmd+V).

## 4. Rules

- Never send anything yourself: the clipboard is the hand-over, the user pastes and sends.
- Write with a short hyphen "-" and straight quotes " and ' from the start; the tool is a safety net, not an excuse.
- No notes about who or what wrote the text, no signatures the user did not ask for.
- One message per clipboard: when there are several drafts, copy one, wait for "next", then copy the next.
